I enjoy computer programming with an emphasis on web development, as well as expanding my knowledge of various programming languages and techniques. I appreciate working through a challenge by careful analysis of the problem and potential solutions. On a personal level, I am a dedicated team player who enjoys collaboration and personal relationships while still being committed to producing quality work. In my spare time, I love exploring different technologies, both web and otherwise, as well as learning about all things related.

I have found that I am most profitable when using my skills to develop meaningful applications that benefit people. Working on behalf of another and seeing the need for a product allows me to share their passion and focus on delivering an experience that meets their needs. This influence has also affected my singing and travels, causing me to travel and sing for a purpose other than solely the experience.
