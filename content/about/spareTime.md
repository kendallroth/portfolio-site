When not working in front of a monitor, I can often be found reading, singing, playing sports...or sitting in front of a monitor. I enjoy pursuing my programming interests in my spare time, whether creating simple games in Unity, experimenting with new web technologies, or relaxing in a co-op game with a group of friends.

However, a rest from the pursuit of technology is vital to maintaining a healthy balance! I also spend a large portion of my spare time reading a wide variety of genres, but particularly fantasy/fiction. Some of my favourite memories include my first glances at _The Hobbit_ and _The Lord of the Rings_, to name a few.

I have always enjoyed several sporting activities, including baseball, ice hockey, volleyball, and now golf. Eye surgery in 2018 enabled me to pursue a lifelong dream of being a goaltender, something that was previously unfeasible. More recently, a small group of friends has developed an interest in playing (or attempting to play) golf. In lieu of a particular sport, I also enjoy hiking and spending time with our youth group.
