Born and raised in a Mennonite setting, I have always had an appreciation for our traditional values and strong work ethic. I have found comfort and meaning in living my life according to the standards God has set out through the Bible. As I continue through life it is my goal to treat everyone with the same love and attention that God has given to us. My faith has also played an integral part in my appreciation for music and nature, as both are capable of bringing peace to me while experiencing troubled times.
