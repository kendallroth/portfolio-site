My first exposure to the world of programming was a self-taught C# and XNA course in high school. I began applying to various programs while working for a year as an electrical apprentice. After being accepted into the [Computer Programmer/Analyst](https://www.conestogac.on.ca/fulltime/computer-programmer-analyst) program at Conestoga College, I began my studies in September 2014.

Although the program was more focused on traditional application programming, I began to develop an interest in web technologies. My co-op placements (specifically Focus21) over sixteen months only furthered this interest. I graduated at the top of my class in June 2018 with a 4.0 GPA. Since graduation, I have continued to explore my interest in web technologies and look to see where it leads in the future.
