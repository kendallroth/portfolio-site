**Flood It** is a simple VueJS version of the well-known "Flood It" game, developed to help me understand how to implement a similar idea in Unity.

The project is built with VueJS and follows Google's Material Design concepts (utilizing the Vuetify component library). It allowed me to experiment with a simple GitLab pipelines workflow, as well as basic Jest tests for the underlying logic.
